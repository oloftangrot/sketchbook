ArduinoDES
==========

DES and Triples DES encryption and decryption library for the Arduino microcontroller platform.
This code was ported from the AVR-Crypto-Lib (http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/AVR-Crypto-Lib).

To install the library, download and copy the files into a subfolder (e.g. "DES") in the 
"libraries" folder of your Arduino development environment.

The library was tested on an Arduino Leonardo.


Usage
=====

It is possible to encrypt and decrypt messages with the DES or Triples DES crypto algorithms.
Have a look at the example code for more information.
