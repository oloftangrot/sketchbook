This library enables easy long range communaction with SX127x family of LoRa modules. It was designed to be used with LoRenz Rev.B shields. However, they are not required and this library can be used with any LoRa module, as long as it is based on of the SX127x chips.

Currently supported chips:
* SX1272 and SX1273
* SX1278, SX1276, SX1277 and SX1279

## As a part of the API changes, all documentation has been moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jgromes/LoRaLib/wiki)! ##
